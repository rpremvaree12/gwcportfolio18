  <h2 id="bio">Bio:</h2>

  <p>I am a MAN who codes from West Orange, NJ. I will be in the 20th grade in the fall, and I am looking forward to teaching girls how to code. I live at home with my wife, Denise, and imaginary pet dog, Parsnip. One day, Parsnip will be a <em>real</em> dog! When I'm not coding, you can find me struggling through marathon training in the humidity, reading about metacognition, learning and lounging in the pool on a noodle.</p>

  <p class="facts"><strong>Likes</strong>: I like to cook and watch many cooking shows. Right now I’m super into Forged in Fire which is kind of like cooking weapons in a hot oven.</p>

  <p class="facts"><strong>Dislikes</strong>: I really don't like cats. Cats don’t like me. They all seem to attack me and make me itch like no other.</p>

  <p class="facts">Fun Fact: I’ve permed my hair and had luxurious curls.. twice.</p>
